# fcos-tools

This repository contains a handful of bash scripts that I've used to automate the process of deploying and managing Fedora CoreOS nodes, as isolated hosts or as part of an [OKD](https://okd.io) cluster. The scripts are generally for vSphere environments, and utilize the [govc](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc) command line tool, but can be modified for other environments and tools. Please see the [Examples page](EXAMPLES.md) for demonstrations of how to use them. Note that govc called from the vmware govc container using Podman. As such, these scripts require that [Podman](https://podman.io) be installed.
